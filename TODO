TODO:
* Biscale RNN. Quarter notes. Complete bars?
* CNN discriminator?
* Bidirectional generator.
* CNN generator? How?
* Similarities/dissimilarities with original image paper?
* Normalize output from G?

DONE:
* Perhaps make cells correspond to a number of ticks, and not arbitrary number of microsecs?
* (32th) And then, make ticks less frequent. Perhaps max resolution a sixteenth note?
* If big difference in loss: let the worst loss be optimized. Literature calls this freezing. I invented it before looking it up.
* Pretrain as normal RNN?
